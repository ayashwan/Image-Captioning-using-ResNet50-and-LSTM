# Image-Captioning-using-ResNet50-and-LSTM


1)The .ipynb contains the code for the final project on "Image Captioning using ResNet50" along with LSTM model.

2)The Flickr8 dataset must be present in the same folder as the python notebook for the code to run smoothly.It can be found on:https://www.kaggle.com/shadabhussain/flickr8k. 
Dataset is 1 GB and has been attached. However,if importing to drive one way to run model using google Colab. 
a. Download the Flicker8k dataset and upload in google drive 
b. Open the notebook through google colab.
c. Change the path in notebook according to the directory structure.
d. Run and evalaute the captions.

3)The dataset contains two folder Fliker8k_dataset which contains images and Flicker8k_text which contains captions.
Subsequent theory for the project have been mentioned as comments in the code as well as in a separate .pdf file named "APM 598_Final Project.pdf" as been attached.
The report contains images and outputs of the various batches and epochs.

4)A separate folder labelled "Training_done_by_ANS" has been attached that contains training data outputs for various batches and epochs.

5)A video titled "APM598_FinalProject_ANS.mp4"is attached as well showing the working of the code
