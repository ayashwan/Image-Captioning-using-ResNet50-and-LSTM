# Image-Captioning-using-ResNet50-and-LSTM


The file contains:
1)The .ipynb contains the code for n "Image Captioning using ResNet50 and LSTM".

2)The Flickr8 dataset must be present in the same folder as the python notebook for the code to run smoothly.It can be found on the drive link:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_0y8VvKxuLg6CAcFB9jS0E06BeshKXMQ?usp=sharing 
Dataset is 1 GB and has been added in the drive folder whose link is provided in the conclusion of the project report.

3)A separate folder labelled "Training_done_by_ANS" has been attached that contains training data outputs for various batches and epochs.

4)A video titled "APM598_FinalProject_ANS.mp4"is attached as well showing the working of the code.
